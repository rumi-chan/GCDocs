## Initiation
Following [Bkebi's incident](/cheats/bkebi#tragic-incident), **Yuuri** and a few remaining devs continued to develop it under a new name - **Sakura**.

However, to avoid repeating mistakes, **Sakura** is only available to a very small number of users
(< 50 users). Therefore, very few people know about it.

## Exclusive features
**Sakura** has all the features of **Bkebi**, moreover **Sakura** also includes features that are only available in the debug version and features that were added later.

Those features include:
- [StatModifier](/features/player#stat-modifier)
- [AttackTeammate](/features/player#friendly-fire)
- [ConstellationModifier](/features/visuals#constellation-modifier)
- [AimBot](/features/player#aimbot)
- [DPSMeter](/features/visuals#dps-meter)
- [Map Manager](/features/world#map-manager)
- AvatarModifier
- AbilityModifier
- ChallengestarterTP

## Leaked
Yes, what [Strigger received](/cheats/korepi#bkebi) was Sakura's compiled file, not the source. But since there are very few users, **Sakura** doesn't have auth or vmprotect, so the binary file is easy to reverse engineer.

It can be said that most of **Korepi**'s "new" features come from **Sakura**.
