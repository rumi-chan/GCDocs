CCGenshin was created and developed by Callow (aka CallowBlack) in version 2.6 based on [Il2CppInspector's C++ scaffolding](https://github.com/djkaty/Il2CppInspector).

It was open source and available at https://github.com/CallowBlack/genshincheat,

At that time it only had few basic features like `Mhyprot bypass`, `Check integrity bypass`, `God mode`, `Dumb enemies`, `Rapid fire`, `Auto talk`, `No cooldowns`, `No clip`, `Auto loot`, `Infinite sprint with "no send move sync" mode`, `Teleport to chest and oculi`, `Map teleportation`, `Kill aura`. `Dialog Skip`, `Mob Vacuum`...
