After [Bkebi](/cheats/bkebi) and [Acrepi](/cheats/acrepi) stopped developing at the same patch, users could no longer use free cheats. 

Fortunately, one of [Bkebi's contributors](/cheats/bkebi#contributors) - **!root**, maintained it under a new name, **Kebabi**.

But it only supports OS, not for CN.

## Feature
Similar to [Acrepi](/cheats/acrepi), added [Gatch URL fetcher](/features/misc#gacha-fetch-url) feature from [Bkebi](/cheats/bkebi)

## Trolling
Yes, it also has gay banner like [Acrepi](/cheats/acrepi). Not only that, **!root** also added 5 other banners, and used 2 overlapping banners to make it difficult for users to find ways to hide the banners.

After several hours of research, I found a way to hide it.

The use of 2 overlapping banners really fooled me at first lol ಥ_ಥ.

The fact that I was able to remove the banner also attracted the attention of the maintainer. And he asked me not to spread it.

But a few days later, with the approval of a friend who is a **Kebabi** support staff, I released this cheat table.

And then there were some people who wrote a banner removal tool based on the cheat table I shared.

After that, **!root** also said there would be no **Kebabi** 3.7 because I shared how to remove the banner.

But before the information could be verified, **Kebabi** suddenly died.

## Sudden death
**June 1, 2023**, **Kebabi's Discord server** suddenly **disappeared**. 

Afterwards, **!root** announced on the **Telegram** channel that the server was **nuke** and all admin and mod discord accounts were **permanently banned**, after which only **!root**'s account was restored.

Maybe this is why only **!root**'s account was restored xD
