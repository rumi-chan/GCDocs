## From external to internal
A long time ago, [Cotton Buds](https://discord.gg/kittenbods) (old name) was a server for **Cheat Engine** users.

**Strigger** - **The Maintainer**, regularly uploads the Cheat Table/Trainer to the [fearlessrevolution](https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?t=21585) forum each patch. So he created this server to be able to conveniently help users.

<p align="center">

</p>

By version 3.6, realizing that the [Kebabi](/cheats/kebabi) was dead, he updated a new internal cheat based on the source code of [Akebi 3.3](/cheats/akebi).

Initially it including features from [Akebi 3.3](/cheats/akebi) base, he later added remaining features from [Bkebi](/cheats/bkebi)

## First release
The first public release was on May 11, 2023 (Genshin 3.6), including the same features as the final release of [akebi free](/cheats/akebi) (Genshin 3.3).

Since this is the first release, there are still quite a few bugs and it's not stable. And this release does not have authentication yet.

## Version
Before becoming [paid](#switch-to-paid), Korepi had 3 versions:
- P (Public) Version: No license required, but limited features such as no Teleport.
- F (Fans) Version: License required from the verification bot in the server.
- V Version: Same as F Version but for Chinese users.

There is also a version specifically for Russian users called Skyrisen, managed by rebornsquad.

## Sponsor
For those who donate, there is an additional [Constellation Modifier](/features/player#constellation-modifier) feature, later updated with many other features

## Dramas
Along with the large number of members comes the amount of drama that [Korepi](/cheats/korepi) has.

### Moderator's Betrayal
The first drama that can be mentioned is the drama with the moderator - **Hiraeth EX**.

Since the early days, he has been the Moderator of the server.

![](/cheats/korepi/moderator.webp)

Everything would have been fine if one day he hadn't announced that [Korepi](/cheats/korepi) was a trojan and told everyone to stop using it.

![](/cheats/korepi/betrayal.webp)

It seems that it was a **Korepi** trojan version that was spread on Telegram. **Strigger** later also spoke up that **Korepi** was only released in the **Discord** server, all releases outside the server were **unreliable**.

![](/cheats/korepi/1.webp)

![](/cheats/korepi/2.webp)

According to some sources, it seems that he asked **Strigger** for more internal access but was denied and he started to spread that [Korepi](/cheats/korepi) had a trojan.

He was banned from the server afterwards.

### Bkebi
The second drama that can be mentioned is the drama with [Bkebi](/cheats/bkebi).

Bkebi's side claims that **Strigger** stole [Bkebi's source code](/cheats/bkebi#tragic-incident) for **Korepi**.

It's also understandable that most of the features added later ([Enhanced Movement](/features/player#enhanced-movement), [Critical Hit](/features/player#critical-hit-hotkeys), [Constellation Modifier](/features/visuals#constellation-modifier)) are from [Bkebi](/cheats/bkebi).

Not only that, they also released screenshot evidence that **Strigger** received the source from someone on [QQ](https://im.qq.com/).

Previously, **Strigger** wondered why **Bkebi** hated him so much.

![](/cheats/korepi/strigger.webp)

After that, former leader of [Bkebi](/cheats/bkebi) - **Yuuri** also spoke up to correct.

![](/cheats/korepi/yuuri.webp)

According to **Yuuri**, **Bkebi** is dead, replaced by a completely new team called **Time Tree**. **Yuuri** and the **old Bkebi devs** have nothing to do with this hatred.

### Strigger's Disappearance
**Since the end of April**, **Strigger** has disappeared without a trace, no one knows where he went.

When version 4.6 was released, everyone was informed that **Strigger** was hospitalized so **Korepi** could not update.

![](/cheats/korepi/announce.webp)

The update was passed on to **Etoshinya** - who was the dev of [Minty](https://github.com/kindawindytoday/Minty-Releases) - Another genshin cheat at that time.

Of course this made the staff not very happy.

Someone even leaked all the old, non-vmp builds of **Korepi**.

<p align="center">
<img src="/cheats/korepi/leak.webp" />
</p>

**June 15, 2024**, some staff discovered that **Strigger** was online and playing VRChat, ignoring everyone in the server looking for him.

![](/cheats/korepi/vrchat.webp)

Soon after that **Strigger** was back online and announced to everyone

![](/cheats/korepi/ass.webp)

After this drama, **Strigger** disappeared again, abandoning the project. **Korepi** will continue to be maintained by **Etoshinya** and **Micah**.

### New server
Since **Strigger** had **abandoned** the project, **Micah** decided to create a new server with **Etoshinya** as the **maintainer**.

Invitation link will be announced when version 5.0 is released.

![](/cheats/korepi/last.webp)

There was also a pretty lame drama before moving to the new server. A staff member said that the project would die and advised everyone to stop buying keys.

![](/cheats/korepi/peach.webp)

But the fact is, the old keys can still be used when moving to the new server.

![](/cheats/korepi/newserver.webp)

This drama is really long and stupid so I won't write about it in detail.
