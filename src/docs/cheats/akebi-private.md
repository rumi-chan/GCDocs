As a paid version of [Akebi](/cheats/akebi), [Akebi-Private](/cheats/akebi-private) is better optimized and promotes user safety.

The source code is no longer public, and only a few contributors can access it.

Old contributors will receive a key valid for 10 years.

## Leaked
Of course the old devs were not comfortable with the fact that Akebi going **paid**. They don't want their code to be used for commercial purposes like this.

Therefore, some old devs leaked some old source parts of Akebi including [DebuggerBypass](https://github.com/xTaiwanPingLord/GenshinDebuggerBypass) and [Akebi 3.3 source](https://github.com/NctimeAza/AnimeGame-Cheat-3.3/).

## Cracked
May 2024, Akebi 4.6 got cracked by [**Marek#1337**](https://github.com/notmarek) and [**Fad#1234**](https://github.com/fadillzzz), and then shared for free at `https://akebisucksballs.lol/`

Not long after that, **Akebi** released a new patch, but the crack can still be used if used with the old version.
