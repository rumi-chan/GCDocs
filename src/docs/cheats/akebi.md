Developed based on [CCGenshin's](https://github.com/CallowBlack/genshincheat) open source code, in cooperation with **Taiga** (aka **Taiga74164**) and later he was the main developer and updater for this project.

It was first released on the UnknownCheats forum in version 2.7: https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/genshin-impact/512860-akebi-genshin-cheat.html

## DMCA
**September 30, 2022**, Akebi received a **DMCA takedown** from **HoYoverse**. **Taiga** and **Callow** have decided to turn the source code for the latest version private on GitLab and will be available to contributors only.

## Switched to paid
**January 16, 2023**, **Callow** announced on the Akebi Discord channel that they will stop releasing for free from version **3.4**. This has caused a lot of controversy from users and previous contributors.

It is also for this reason that [Acrepi](/cheats/acrepi) and [Bkebi](/cheats/bkebi) were born

**January 19, 2023**, Akebi officially released the first [paid](/cheats/akebi-private) version
