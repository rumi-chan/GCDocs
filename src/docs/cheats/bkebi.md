After [Akebi](/cheats/akebi) switched to [paid](/cheats/akebi#switched-to-paid), a group of developers from **Hong Kong**, **Taiwan**, and **China** established a new organization to continue development based on the source code of [Akebi 3.3](/cheats/akebi) named **Bkebi** with the Kiwi fruit logo.

**Bkebi** is developed and updated more continuously than [Acrepi](/cheats/acrepi), with the introduction of many new features that even [Akebi-Private](/cheats/akebi-private) did not have at that time: [Constellation Modifier](/features/visuals#constellation-modifier), [Remote Utility](/features/player#remote-utility), [Elemental Aura](/features/world#elemental-aura), [Auto Puzzle](/features/world#auto-puzzle)...

**Bkebi** is also more optimized by the developers as they have rewritten the shit code of the [Akebi](/cheats/akebi) base, giving users the best experience.

and many other unreleased features

## Verification
Yep, the first 3 released versions of **Bkebi** did not have an authentication system, but from version **v1.1.1** the authentication system has been added.

To be able to use **Bkebi**, you need the **Member** role. If not, you can only try it for [1 day](/cheats/bkebi#trial-license)

<p align="center">
<img src="/cheats/bkebi/role.webp">
</p>

This role is directly approved by **Admin/Moderator**. For review, you must submit your **GitHub** profile link to the **#member_invite** channel and wait for approval.

> After discussion and negotiation between the management team and developers, we have planned for a better review system that will improve efficiency and approval rates, while also ensuring that we have a healthier community environment and comprehensive protection of developers' achievements. Below we will announce it.

> According to our plan, we will open server invitations on the 15th and 30th (28th) of each month. Please note that the sending of server invitations will close after one day of being open.

> Four days after server invitation is closed, we will open the 成员邀请-member_invite channel for one day, giving members the opportunity to become our Github members and receive the Member role.

> Please note that you have up to 3 chances to send Github links. If all 3 attempts fail, you will be blocked. Do not think that deleting your link submission after failing to pass the review will not count towards your attempts, as we have server logs. If we find that you have deleted your link submission, you will be blocked directly.

> After the Github invitation link is closed, we will begin reviewing all invitation applications. The review period will last for 8-10 days to ensure that every application is carefully reviewed and considered. Regarding review standards, the reviewers have established corresponding standards and will strictly enforce them. Our review standards will not be made public, and our managers will not "open backdoors" for anyone. Spreading rumors will result in a ban/block.

> We hope that you can understand that these regulations and systems are designed to ensure the health of our community, protect the rights and interests of developers, and make it easier for more people who like/want to use Bkebi to pass the review.

> Finally, we welcome all members who love the Bkebi community and want to use Bkebi. Thank you for your understanding and support of Bkebi! The Bkebi management team hereby announces this.

**In the early days**, many users cheated by using someone else's **GitHub** link to apply. After that, to filter and prevent fraud, all **Member** roles were **revoked** and users were required to **bind** their **GitHub** link to **Discord** to automatically receive the role back.

## Get license
I already have the role, so what should I do next?

To start using **Bkebi**, you need a `BKEBI-ISFREE-NOT4SALE.LIC` license.

To get this, there were 2 types: **Bkebi License** and **Trial License**.

### Bkebi License
If you have **Member** role, type `/generate free [type]:Bkebi [version]:3.5.0 [hwid]:YOUR_HWID` in **#keygen** to get license. Download it and put in the **Bkebi** folder to use

### Trial License
To get the trial license, type `/generate trial` in **#keygen** then the license will be created. Download and put it in the **Bkebi** folder to use.

Trial license does not require an HWID but is for 1 user only and expires after 24 hours

The HIWD can be found in the console:

</p>

Get key successfully:

</p>

### [Bonus] Goodbye License
This is the license shared by **@RedDango** before he closed the keygen bot, valid until April 12, 2024

<img src="/cheats/bkebi/goodbye.webp">

As of the time I write this, this is the only valid license.

## Tragic Incident

**March 16, 2023**, Bkebi's leader - **Yuuri** suddenly announced that **Bkebi** would disband due to a member of the development team <span style="color:red;">leaking</span> the source code.

<img src="/cheats/bkebi/rip.webp">

This announcement made everyone surprised and extremely sad.

Not long after, **RedDango** shared the [Goodbye License](/cheats/bkebi#bonus-goodbye-license) for everyone to use bkebi for free until version 3.5.

It's a pity for a legend, all the efforts of [developers](/cheats/bkebi#contributors) are thrown away.

## Revival?
According to some sources, currently **Bkebi** has been continued to be developed by a new organization, **Time Tree**, but not publicly. Only allowed to a small number of testers.
