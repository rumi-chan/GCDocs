This page is a comprehensive wiki dedicated to detailing all the features available in the public **Genshin Impact** cheat. Here, you will find in-depth explanations and guides on how to utilize each feature, along with any relevant tips or warnings. Please note that using cheats can sometimes violate game policies and may result in account suspension or banning. Proceed with caution and use responsibly.

In addition, this wiki also introduces you to the history of previously publicly available cheat software, helping you better understand their development history.

::: tip Disclaimer
This page will only write about cheats based on Akebi's open source code, I will not mention other cheats.

## Author
As an user from the early days, going through different stages of GI cheat, I write this docs with the purpose of archiving and passing it on to future newcomers.

Seeing the end of cheats coming, I made this site public as a place to remember.

And again, using cheats is not recommended. If anything goes wrong, please contact me to take this page down.
